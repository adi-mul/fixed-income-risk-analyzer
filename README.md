🧱 System Architecture & Technologies
✅ Backend (Java, Spring Boot, SQL)

Java: Core language for high-performance and secure backend logic.

Spring Boot: Builds REST APIs, handles financial calculations, and application logic.

SQL: Manages structured storage of bond data, market rates, and user reports.

✅ Frontend (TypeScript, JavaScript)

TypeScript: Adds type safety and scalability to the frontend.

JavaScript: Drives interactive components and dynamic UI rendering in-browser.

💡 Key Features & Technologies
1. 📊 Market Data Dashboard

SOFR Index Visualisation

Interactive Graph & Table: Built using JavaScript/TypeScript libraries (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js).

Real-time SOFR data fetched via REST API (Spring Boot backend).

2. 🧾 Bond Portfolio Management

Bond Input Form: Developed in TypeScript, with form validation and dynamic UI.

Data persistence: Bond attributes stored in SQL via Spring Boot API.

3. 📈 Comprehensive Risk & Return Reporting

Yield to Maturity (YTM), Current Yield, Real Rate of Return:

Financial models computed in Java (Spring Boot).

Inflation Risk Metrics:

Calculations for Break-Even Inflation & Inflation Risk Premium via backend logic.

Default & Liquidity Risk Assessment:

Static and dynamic modelling handled in Java, supported by SQL data.

4. 💰 Valuation Engine

Fixed-Rate Bond Valuation: Present value computation in Java backend.

Floating-Rate Bond Valuation: Uses projected SOFR curve logic in Java, integrated with historical rate data from SQL.

5. 🌐 Economic Impact Analysis

Inflation Effect Modeling: Graphical analysis via TypeScript/JavaScript.

Spread Analysis & Prediction:

YTM vs Treasury yield spread visualization using frontend charting libraries.

Predictive models implemented on Java backend (basic rule-based; future-ready for ML).
